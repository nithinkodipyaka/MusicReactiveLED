# MusicReactiveLED
Music Reactive LED Strip

This project aims to improve the user's music listening experience by synchronizing visuals with the audio. It involves creating a sound-reactive LED strip that shows patterns of different colors in sync with the music, thereby creating an aesthetically pleasing effect. The project uses an Arduino board and other equipment to create a music-responsive LED lighting system.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the music-responsive LED lighting system on your computer.

## Prerequisites
-Arduino IDE installed on your computer

-Arduino Uno R3 board

-WS2812B LED light strip

-Sound detection sensor module (with potentiometer)

-Breadboard

-Jumper wires

## Installing
Clone this repository onto your computer.

Connect the Arduino board, LED light strip, and sound detection sensor module according to the circuit diagram provided in the project.

Open the Arduino IDE and load the code provided in the project.

Upload the code to the Arduino board.

Power on the circuit and enjoy the music-responsive LED lighting system!

## Running the tests
You can test the system by playing music and observing how the LED light strip responds to the music. The system should create patterns of different colors that change in sync with the beat and rhythm of the music.

## Built With
-Arduino Uno R3

-WS2812B LED light strip
